# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview
OctoAcme's project management framework is built on principles of customer-first, iterative delivery, where clear ownership and data-informed decisions drive execution. Projects follow a structured lifecycle starting with **Initiation**, where a "One-pager" defines the problem, goals (SMART), and stakeholders before a go/no-go decision is made. Once approved, projects move to **Planning**, which involves creating a prioritized backlog, estimating scope, and defining a "Definition of Done" (DoD). This phase also emphasizes identifying risks and dependencies early, ensuring that the team is aligned on the release timeline and milestones before execution begins.

The **Execution & Tracking** phase operates on a strict rhythm of daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and regular demos. Work is managed through project boards with clear columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, etc.) and a Pull Request workflow that mandates automated testing, linting, and peer reviews. **Quality Assurance** is integrated throughout, with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end smoke tests required before release. Security scanning is automated in CI, and manual QA is used for specific feature acceptance. Risks are actively managed via a Risk Register, with defined escalation paths from the team level up to sponsors for critical blockers.

Communication and continuous improvement are central to the process. **Roles** are clearly defined: Project Managers coordinate delivery and risks, Product Managers define value and priority, and Developers focus on implementation and quality. Communication is standardized through weekly status updates, incident playbooks, and stakeholder briefings. Finally, the process loop is closed with **Retrospectives** after every sprint or major milestone. These sessions focus on actionable improvements, which are tracked in the backlog to ensure the team constantly evolves its workflows and efficiency.
